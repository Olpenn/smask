\section{Introduction}
Statistical machine learning is a subject that aims to build and train algorithms, that analyse large amount of data, and make predictions for the future, which are computed by using established statistical models, and tools from functional analysis. This is a project in supervised, statistical machine learning, where several models were created, and trained, in order to analyse which one of them gives best prediction for the project "Do we need more bikes", where we want to understand, and predict if there is a high, or low demand of city bikes in the public transportation of Washington, a project by the District Department of Transportation in Washington D.C..

The data set used for training our models, consist of 15 variables, containing quantitative/qualitative data. We developed several models, and evaluated them with cross-validation, in order to understand which algorithm gives the best prediction.
