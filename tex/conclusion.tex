\section{Conclusion}

From the evaluation the models, k-nn performed the best with the highest accuracy and precision. 
As for the recall, k-nn did not perform the best but is considered adequate and hence this method is chosen as the best one.
\\
\\
One reason for the discriminant analysis falling short of the other models is likely due to these models
being designed with the assumption of variables being normally distributed.
This is not the case for this particular data set.
