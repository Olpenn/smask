\section{Conclusion}

From the evaluation the two models k-nn performed the best with the highest accuracy and precision. 
As for the recall this is not the highest but is considered adequate and hence this method is chosen.
\\
\\
One reason for the discriminant analysis falling short of the other models is likely due to these models
being designed with the assumption of variables being normally distributed.
This is not the case for this particular data set.
