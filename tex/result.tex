\section{Result}

The method used to evaluate the different models where simply chosen to be the accuracy defined by:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{accuracy} = \frac{n_{correct}}{n_{tot}}
\end{equation*}
The different models were tested and the accuracy where:
\\
\begin{table*}[h]
    \begin{center}
        Accuracy of the models
        \\
        \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
            \hline
            Model & Accuracy \\
            \hline
            LDA & $86\%$ \\
            QDA & $86\%$ \\
            Random forrest & $91\%$\\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table*}
Here you can clearly see random forest is the best classifier and is the model that the group would use in production.
This is because it has the highest accuracy score and f1 score for high_demand.
The second part being the most important criteria meaning considering in this application false negatives are the most costly in this scenario causing a loss in revenue for the bike company.
