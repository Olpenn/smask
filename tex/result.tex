\section{Result}

The method used to evaluate the different models where simply chosen to be the accuracy defined by:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{accuracy} = \frac{n_{correct}}{n_{tot}}
\end{equation*}
The different models were tested and the accuracy where:
\\
\begin{table*}[h]
    \begin{center}
        Accuracy of the models
        \\
        \begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
            \hline
            Model & Accuracy \\
            \hline
            LDA & $86\%$ \\
            QDA & $86\%$ \\
            Random forrest & $91\%$\\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table*}

Here you can clearly see random forset is the best clasifier and is the model that the group would use in production. 
This because it has the highest accuracy score and f1 scora for high_demand. 
The second part being the most imoprtant criteria meaning considering in this aplication false negatives are the most costly in this senario.
