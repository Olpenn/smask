% \subsection{From Intro}

% \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
%     \item Explotre and preprocess data
%     \item try some or all classification methods, which are these?
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Logistic Regression
%         \item Discriminant analysis: LDA, QDA
%         \item K-nearest neighbor
%         \item Tree-based methods: classification trees, random forests, bagging
%         \item Boositing
%     \end{itemize} 
%     \item Which of these are to be "put in producion"?
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{From Data analysis task}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Can any trend be seen comparing different hours, weeks, months?
%     \item Is there any diffrence between weekdays and holidays?
%     \item Is there any trend depending on the weather?
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{From Implementation of methods}

% Each group member should implement one family each, who did what shall be clear!

% DNNs are encouraged to be implemented, do this if there is time. 
% (DNN is not a thing a group member can claim as their family.)

% Implement a naive version, let's do: $\textit{Always low\_bike\_demand}$
% \subsubsection{What to do with each method}
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Implement the method (each person individually)
%     \item Tune hyper-parameters, discuss how this is done (each person individually)
%     \item Evaluate with for example cross-validation. Don't use $E_{k-fold}$ (what is that?) (need to do together)
%     \item (optional) Think about input features, are all relevant? (together)
% \end{enumerate}

% Before training, unify pre-processing FOR ALL METHODS and choose ONE OR MULTIPLE metrics to evaluate the model.
% (is it neccesary to have the same for all?, is it beneficial?) Examples:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item accuracy
%     \item f1-score
%     \item recall
%     \item precision
% \end{itemize}

% Use same test-train split for ALL MODELS
